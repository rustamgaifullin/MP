# MP
I don't remember what MP stands for.

Any way...

MP utilizes default _Monthly Budget_ spreadsheet template from Google Sheets allowing easily add and monitor expenses.

The main idea behind the project is to be able to control monthly budget in old fashion way using excel like table from Mac or PC and be mobile in the same time by using an android phone to quickly add expenses on the way from store, restaurant, gas station, etc.

The plan at the moment is to have stable application which can be used as quick tool for adding expenses using android phone and monitor your budget on prepared spreadsheet in Google Drive.
 
Next step is to create a spreadsheet from the scratch using android phone only and make it independent from Mac\PC.
